# foobar-solutions

**What is this?**

Google Foobar is an invitation-based hiring challenge for 'curious developers' who like to solve 'interesting problems'. Apparently it's based on your search history.

I am not a developer, and not a coder - I'd just started learning Python about a week prior to receiving the challenge. The invitation popped up while I was googling basic Python syntax - I think it was about how to add to a list in Python. For some reason the Google algorithm decided I was a good fit for this challenge. 

These were my solutions - all the levels are complete, with all test cases passing. I'd say it took me about two months in total, and I very nearly failed level 4, nearly running out of time on "Running with Bunnies".

Feel free to have a look if you're stuck - as I've mentioned earlier, I'm very much a novice to this sort of thing, so my solutions take a relatively naive approach which might be easier to understand. The code is also far from optimal, and I'm hoping to look back at this code in a few years time and be able to say that I've improved.
