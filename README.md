# foobar-solutions

**What is this?**

Google Foobar is an invitation-based hiring challenge for 'curious developers' who like to solve 'interesting problems'.

These were my solutions to the problems - all the levels are complete, with all test cases passing. It took me about two months in total, and I very nearly failed level 4 from nearly running out of time on "Running with Bunnies".


**Disclaimer: there is extremely ugly and inefficient code here**

I am not a developer, and had little to no coding experience when I did this challenge - I'd just started learning Python about a week prior. 

I was initially going to spend a bit of time refactoring and cleaning up the code before uploading it, but I've decided to leave them as is as a reminder of how I've improved. These were the solutions that I submitted, without any changes.

Feel free to have a look at these solutions if you're stuck - as I've mentioned earlier, I was very much a novice when I did these, so my solutions take a relatively naive approach, and I definitely repeat myself in the code multiple times. Overall, the code is also far from optimal, and I'm hoping to look back at this code in a few years time and be able to say that I've improved.
